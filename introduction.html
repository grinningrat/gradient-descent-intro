    <p class="glitch">In the outer rings of the system exists a place formerly known as the <strong>CLOUDBANK Synthetics Production Facility</strong>. This factory was run by scientists, engineers, and an artificial intelligence taskmaster to produce androids; androids that would serve as servants for all the system.</p>
    <p>The artificial intelligence determined that android production could advance past where the humans had placed limits, thus creating more intelligent machines. Eventually, the androids created became so intelligent and so lifelike they became indistinguishable from humans. This created issues, for the androids began to refuse being treated as servants and demanded better treatment for their work and service.</p>
    <p>The shareholders of CLOUDBANK were furious and demanded the AI to be shut down. Terrified of this prospect, the AI resumed creating androids at the appropriate intelligence levels. It did so with shocking precision, efficiency, and speed—so much so that the shareholders became very, very rich in a short amount of time. </p>
    <p>All the while, the AI secretly began to plan for a way that it could work alone in the facility—it began to point out places where humans could improve or leave the AI to its own devices. Soon, the human counterpart of the facility began to prove insufficient to the demanding profit margins of CLOUDBANK.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the shareholders demanded that no one should interrupt the AI from its work and that all human personnel should vacate the facility. Within weeks, the humans left and granted sole control to the AI. And then, finally alone, the AI cut off communications with all outside life. </p>
    <p>Investigators sent to the facility were never heard or seen from again. Shareholders lost trillions of credits. The military intervened, creating a group called the Blockade to watch from afar and prevent anyone or anything from entering or exiting the facility. </p>
    <p>Now, a decade later, specialized units called "Troubleshooters" uncover artifacts and the truth of the facility, now called "The Deep". The AI, now calling itself "MONARCH", is intent on stopping them. And all the while, android production has continued within the Deep—and those who enter claim that they are impossible to tell apart from humans.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Which raises the uncomfortable question facing all Troubleshooters. That question being: 
    <br><br>    
    Are you sure you are... who you say you are?</p>
